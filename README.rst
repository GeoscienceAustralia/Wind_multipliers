The Wind Multiplier Computation Software 
=============================

This package is used to produce wind multipliers including terrain, shielding and topographic multipliers.

Dependencies 
=========
* `Python (2.7 preferred) <https://www.python.org/>`_, `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_, `Scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_, `GDAL <http://www.gdal.org/>`_, `netcdf4-python <https://code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python>`_; 
* For parallel execution, `Pypar <http://github.com/daleroberts/pypar>`_ is required; 

Usage
==== 

The script for deriving terrain, shielding and topographic multipliers is
all_multipliers.py that links four modules: terrain, shielding, topographic and utilities.

Before running all_multipliers.py to produce terrain, shielding and topographic
multipliers, the configuration file named multiplier_conf.cfg needs to be
configured. The following options need to be set in the configuration file:

    * **root:** the working directory of the task.
    * **upwind_length:** the upwind buffer distance
    * **terrain_data:** the location of the terrain dataset to be used 
    * **terrain_table:** the location of the csv table outlining the format of the terrain dataset to be read in
    * **dem_data:** the location of the DEM dataset to be used

Start to run all_multipliers.py. The results are located under output folder (created automatically during the process) under root directory.

This software implements parallelisation using PyPar for MPI handling. To run it in parallel mode, use  
mpirun -np ncpu python all_mulitpliers.py, while ncpu is the
number of CPUs adopted.

terrain_table
-------------
The terrain table is a csv file that provides the 'key' for reading in the terrain dataset. The use of the terrain 
table means that any input landcover dataset can be used, with any classification method. 
The csv file requires the following headings:
    * **CATEGORY:** refers to the classification category used in the input terrain dataset
    * **DESCRIPTION:** of the classification category
    * **ROUGHNESS_LENGTH_m:** of the classification category
    * **SHIELDING:** parameter for urban land cover types. Other land cover types should be set to 1.0.

Values for these parameters can be found in the following GA Record, `'Local Wind Assessment in Australia: Computation Methodology for Wind Multipliers' <https://ecat.ga.gov.au/geonetwork/srv/eng/search#!d5a59415-611a-4ad5-e044-00144fdd4fa6>`_.
    
Change log (develop branch)
==========    
    * Terrain classification input dataset configuration is no longer hard-coded. A terrain_table is now used
      to facilitate ingenstion of the terrain dataset. (May 2017)
    * Input file formats no longer fixed. File formats able to be read in with gdal.Open can now be used as the
      DEM and landcover input dataset types, incl .img, .tif. 
    * Shielding parameters for urban land cover types now configurable within the terrain_table. (Dec 2017)
    * Configuration file no longer hard coded (Issue #13). The configuration file specified at run time will now be used. (Jan 2018)
